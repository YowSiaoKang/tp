## Navigating the GUI

Match has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides a pleasant visual experience on top of comprehensive functionality.
Here is a quick look at the **two** different tabs present in Match:

### Volunteers Tab
Volunteers tab is the default tab, displaying all volunteers :ok_man: and their availability on a single screen. This view is useful for finding volunteers, which you will learn how to accomplish later!

![Volunteers Tab](images/VolunteersTab.png)

### Assignments Tab
Assignments tab is the alternate tab that displays all assignments :briefcase:. This view helps you manage all the assignments for your volunteers.

![Assignments Tab](images/AssignmentsTab.png)

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Command are case-sensitive and are to be  in `lower_case`. <br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `add` is a command which should be in lower-case.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/elderly` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/elderly`, `t/climate t/hospital` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

  - Only accepts spaces and alphanumeric characters.
  - Does not allow for duplication. You will be not allowed to add 2 volunteers with the 'same' name. the following points will explain what is considered 'same'.
  - For flexibility, upper and lower cases are considered distinct. <br>
  e.g. `Bob` and `bob` are considered 2 different entities.

  e.g. `John[space]Doe` is different from `John[space][space]Doe`.
- PHONE_NUMBER :1234:
  - Only accepts numbers.

- You can **remove all** the volunteer’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
- Constraints for email, phone number and tag(s) are similar to that of [add](#adding-a-volunteer-add) command.

</div>

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st volunteer to `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

Format: `export`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Take Note:**<br>

- When using the application for the first time, executing the `export` command when the `addressbook.json` is missing will result in an error. Try executing other commands first. This will result `addressbook.json` file to be created.

What you should see:<br>
![help](images/features/help.jpg)

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Sad to see you go :frowning_face:, this exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Accessing the command history

Superpower to see the past :superhero:.

To access the command history:

- From the input field, press the down arrow key (↓) to bring out the drop-down menu of previous commands.
- Use the up (↑) and down (↓) arrow keys to navigate through the command history.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Take Note**<br>
- After you enter a command, the command history will automatically close. If you wish to close the command history manually, you have two options:
    1. Press the `Ctrl` key on your keyboard.
    2. Click anywhere outside of the command history dropdown.
- Long input commands will be truncated when viewed in the command history. This has no effect on the functioning of the command history or the execution of previous commands.

</div>

What you should see:<br>
![commandhistory](images/features/CommandHistory.png)

### Using the autocomplete

Become the fastest typist :keyboard:! Autocomplete provides suggestions based on your command history as you type. You can navigate through the suggestions using the arrow keys, similar to the command history.

What you should see:<br>
![autocomplete](images/features/AutoComplete.png)

### Saving the data

Match data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Data cascading

As `persons` and `assignments` list are related performing actions on one of the lists will result changes to be cascaded to ensure data consistency.

### Editing the data file

Match data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Match will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Match to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

<font color="green"> === Congratulations you have mastered all the elements you are now a qualified wizard :mage:! === </font>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Match home folder.


**Q**: Why are all of my volunteers and assignments suddenly gone?<br>
**A**: The problem is most likely that your JSON file is corrupted or edited. Be careful on not to edit your JSON file directly and only use commands to do so.You can solve this by manually adding your volunteers and assignments again.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **Invisible input caret**, there are times when the input caret (cursor) may become invisible even though the input field has focus. To resolve this, regain focus in the input field by pressing the Tab key a few times.
